  Favorite Vacation
</h2>
<p>
  My Favorite vacation was when I was 14 my Family saved up all year so we could go to Greece.
  It's the only time I've ever been in Europe and it was a really unique experience.
  The whole culture was so diffrent from that of Utah it was a really enriching experience.
